# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

This is a tool that consumes a text in .txt format and 
1) calculates the number of words, and
2) calculates how often alphabetic symbols appear in the text, and sort them by frequency

Step 1.
Close the code to your machine.

Step 2.
Create a directory in the root of the project; call it "books"

Step 3. Add a .txt file to the /books directory.

Step 4. Run the command "python3 main.py books/NAME.txt>" in the terminal while being in the project root directory.
